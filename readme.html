    This is the readme for the models associated with the paper:

    Komarov M, Bazhenov M (2016)
    Linking dynamics of the inhibitory network to the input structure.
    J Comput Neurosci
    doi: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10827-016-0622-8">10.1007/s10827-016-0622-8</a>

    This C++ code was contributed by M Komarov.

    Usage:
    This code (for figure 9 in the paper) can be compiled with commands like:

    g++ main1.cpp -o main1
    g++ main2.cpp -o main2
    g++ main3.cpp -o main3

    and then run with commands like:
    ./main1
    ./main2
    ./main3

    Each program takes about a minute to run (on a 2012 MacBook Pro laptop).

    You can plot the results with the included python file:

    python pl_ts.py

    which generates graphs similar to figure 9 in the paper:
